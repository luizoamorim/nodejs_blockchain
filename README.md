# My private test blockchain

## What is blockchain?
It is a digital record that contains all the history of transactions carried 
out on the network.

## Which are the main objectives of this technology?

- Keep data immutable and permanent;
- Ensure secure data transactions;
- Eliminate the need for an intermediary. For example, banks in the middle of financial transactions.

In this project I'll show its main concepts:
- hash;
- blocks;
- memory pool;
- consensus algorithms and mining;
- sign a transaction;
